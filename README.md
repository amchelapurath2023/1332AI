# CodeGradr

Codegradr is a web application using generative AI to provide feedback for routine, structured coding assignments. As teaching assistants, spending four to five hours a week grading coding assignments that often have the same handful of bugs between them was time consuming. However, for a student, it is really important to receive feedback and a thorough explanation of where you went wrong. Generative AI is the perfect outlet for automating this problem away.

The way CodeGradr works is you upload the files containing 1) your test cases (e.g. JUnits) for the assignment, and 2) the correct implementation.

Copy and paste a student's code, then click "Compile" and "Run" in sequence to make sure the code works.

Then, click "Generate Feedback" for a ChatGPT generated response based on the JUnits the student's code failed and the correct implementation.
